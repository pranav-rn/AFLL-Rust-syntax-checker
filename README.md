# AFLL-Rust-syntax-checker
# MiniRustLexer

**RustLexer** is a custom lexer and parser built with Python's [PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) library to interpret a subset of Rust syntax. The project demonstrates how to tokenize and parse basic Rust constructs like variable declarations, mutable variables, function definitions, conditional statements, loops, and print statements in a Rust-inspired format.

### Features

- **Tokenizing and Parsing**:
- **Variable Declarations**: Supports (`let`) variable declarations.
- **Control Flow**: Parses basic control flow structures including `if-else` statements, and `while` loops.
- **Expressions**: Recognizes integers, floats, and string literals, with basic assignment operations and comparisons.

### Project Structure

The project contains:

- **Lexer Rules**: Rules to recognize Rust-like keywords, operators, symbols, and literals.
- **Parser Rules**: Rules to parse and validate Rust-like statements, including conditional statements and loops.
- **Test Cases**: A set of Rust-like example statements to test the lexer and parser.

### Usage

#### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RustLexer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd RustLexer
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python and the PLY library installed. Install PLY if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install ply
   ```

### Running the Lexer and Parser

1. Run the `RustLexer.py` file to tokenize and parse the example Rust-like code:

   ```bash
   python RustLexer.py
   ```

2. You will see output indicating whether each test case is syntactically correct or not.

#### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s an example of the Rust-like syntax that this lexer and parser can handle:

```rust
let x=10;                
while (x>5) {let y=20;}        
if (x==15) {let z=30;} else {let z=40;}
while (x>5 {let y=20;}
if (x<15 {let z=30;} else {let z=40;}
let y = 3.14;            
let name = "hello";   
let grade = 'A';
```

Each line in the example will be tokenized and parsed, with output indicating correct syntax or any syntax errors detected in the structure.

### Project Roadmap

Currently, **RustLexer** focuses on a simplified subset of Rust syntax. Future enhancements could include:

- **Support for Advanced Rust Features**: Expanding the lexer and parser to handle more complex Rust syntax, such as pattern matching, ownership and borrowing, traits, and custom data types.
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Improving the error-handling capabilities for more informative syntax error messages.
- **Testing Suite**: Adding a suite of automated tests to validate the lexer and parser against a variety of Rust code examples.
