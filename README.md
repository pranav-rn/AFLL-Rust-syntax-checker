# AFLL-Rust-syntax-checker
RustLexer is a custom lexer and parser built with Python's PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library to interpret a subset of Rust syntax. The project demonstrates how to tokenize and parse basic Rust constructs like variable declarations, mutable variables, function definitions, conditional statements, loops, and print statements in a Rust-inspired format.

Features
Tokenizing and Parsing:
Variable Declarations: Supports both mutable (let mut) and immutable (let) variable declarations.
Function Definitions: Recognizes simple function definitions with the fn keyword.
Control Flow: Parses basic control flow structures including if-else statements, while loops, and for loops.
Print Statements: Supports the println! macro for basic print functionality with expressions.
Expressions: Recognizes integers, floats, and string literals, with basic assignment operations and comparisons.
Project Structure
The project contains:

Lexer Rules: Rules to recognize Rust-like keywords, operators, symbols, and literals.
Parser Rules: Rules to parse and validate Rust-like statements, including conditional statements, loops, and function structures.
Test Cases: A set of Rust-like example statements to test the lexer and parser.
Usage
Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/RustLexer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd RustLexer
Ensure you have Python and the PLY library installed. Install PLY if needed:

pip install ply
Running the Lexer and Parser
Run the RustLexer.py file to tokenize and parse the example Rust-like code:

python RustLexer.py
You will see output indicating whether each test case is syntactically correct or not.

Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s an example of the Rust-like syntax that this lexer and parser can handle:

let x = 10;
let mut y = 20;
while (x > 5) { let z = 20; }
if (x == 15) { let z = 30; } else { let z = 40; }
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) { let j = i; }
Each line in the example will be tokenized and parsed, with output indicating correct syntax or any syntax errors detected in the structure.

Project Roadmap
Currently, RustLexer focuses on a simplified subset of Rust syntax. Future enhancements could include:

Support for Advanced Rust Features: Expanding the lexer and parser to handle more complex Rust syntax, such as pattern matching, ownership and borrowing, traits, and custom data types.
Detailed Error Reporting: Improving the error-handling capabilities for more informative syntax error messages.
Testing Suite: Adding a suite of automated tests to validate the lexer and parser against a variety of Rust code examples.
